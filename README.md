# Overview

TripJot is a passion project - a microservice android app built so that users can store and access all their memories in one place, while on the go. One of the primary features include login and sign up options, so users can ensure all data is privately stored for their viewing. Users can add a new note - which has details such as pictures, location (as chosen on maps, linked with the Goggle Maps API), calendar, title and description/notes. The notes currently persist in the local storage of the user's phone, but future modifications will allow for cloud storage. Notes can be viewed and tagged locations can also be viewed in a Map View. Future updates will also include different Views (Maps, Calendar, Listed Notes). The app currently allows the user to delete notes and in the near future, users can go back and edit previously stored notes as well.
